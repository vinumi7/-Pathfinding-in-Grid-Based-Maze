# -Pathfinding-in-Grid-Based-Maze
Implemented Uniform Cost Search and A* to find shortest paths in 6Ã—6 mazes with random barriers, start,  and goal nodes. Used Chebyshev Distance as the heuristic and tested over multiple randomized mazes.  Analyzed performance in terms of completeness, optimality, and time complexity.
